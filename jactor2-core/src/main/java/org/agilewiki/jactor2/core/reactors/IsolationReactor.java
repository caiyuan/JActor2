/**
 * A targetReactor which processes each request to completion. And unlike other types of
 * reactors, an IsolationReactor should usually be used only by a single blades.
 * <p>
 * For thread safety, the processing of each message is done in isolation from other messages, but when the processing of a message
 * results in the sending of a request message to another blades, other messages may be processed before a
 * response to that request message is received. However, an isolation targetReactor will not process a
 * request until a response is returned for the prior request. This does not however preclude
 * the processing of event messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AsyncRequest/Response messages which are destined to a different targetReactor are buffered rather
 * than being sent immediately. These messages are disbursed to their destinations when the
 * processing of each incoming message is complete.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the last block of buffered messages is being disbursed, if the destination is not
 * a thread-bound targetReactor, the destination targetReactor has no associated thread and the
 * facility of the current targetReactor is the same as the destination targetReactor, then the
 * current thread migrates with the message block. By this means the message block is
 * often kept in the hardware thread's high-speed memory cache, which means much faster
 * execution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Inbox used by IsolationReactor is IsolationInbox.
