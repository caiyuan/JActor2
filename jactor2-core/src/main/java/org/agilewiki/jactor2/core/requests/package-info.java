/**
 * <h1>Events, Requests, Responses and Exception Handling</h1>
 * <p>
 *     There are two types of messaging, 1-way (events) and 2-way (request/response).
 * </p>
 * <h2>Event Messages</h2>
 * <p>
 *     Event messages are created and passed using subclasses of the Event class.
 *     An event is not bound to an blades instance, so the same event can be used to
 *     doSend messages to any number of blades. And when passing an event message to an blades,
 *     the message is given to the target blades's processing immediately, without buffering.
 * </p>
 * <h2>AsyncRequest/Response Messages</h2>
 * <p>
 *     In contrast, request messages are created and passed using anonymous subclasses of
 *     the AsyncRequest class, with these anonymous classes present within the blades where the
 *     request message is evaluated. Response messages are simply request messages to which a
 *     response has been assigned. AsyncRequest and response messages are aggregated and sent in
 *     blocks to reduce the overhead of having to pass individual messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     No messages are being processed when a message block is sent. So when the last message
 *     block is sent, the thread migrates to the destination targetReactor along with that
 *     block. More often than not, only a single block of messages is sent, so thread migration
 *     significantly reduces the overhead of message passing.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 *     Exception handlers are used to process otherwise uncaught exceptions. But if there is no
 *     exception handler, or if an exception is thrown by an exception handler, then the
 *     exception is returned as a response, though if the current message being processed is
 *     an event then the exception is simply logged. When a response message that
 *     holds an exception is processed by the source targetReactor, the exception is rethrown
 *     within the source blades rather than being pass back to the blades as a valid response.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     Before an event or a request is processed, the current exception handler is set
 *     to null. The application logic specific to that event or request then has the option of assigning
 *     an exception handler via the Reactor.setExceptionHandler method. When a request message
 *     is sent, the current exception handler is saved in the request message and subsequently
 *     restored when a response is received.
 * </p>
