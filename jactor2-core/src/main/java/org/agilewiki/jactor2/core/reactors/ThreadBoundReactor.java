/**
 * A targetReactor bound to a pre-existing thread, a thread-bound targetReactor can use
 * a program's main thread or a GUI thread.
 * <p>
 * For thread safety, the processing of each message is done in isolation, but when the processing of a
 * message results in the sending of a request, other messages may be processed before a
 * response to that request is received.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AsyncRequest/Response messages which are destined to a different targetReactor are buffered rather
 * than being sent immediately. These messages are disbursed to their destinations when all
 * incoming messages have been processed.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Sample Usage:</h3>
