Multi-threaded Programming for Robustness
======

JActor2 is a robust actor framework written in Java.

Actors are an important innovation as they make it easy to write thread-safe code free of race conditions.
This is because all operations on the state of an actor are performed using the same thread.
So operations are performed one at a time, in the same sequence they are received by the actor.
