<h1>Closeable - Assured Close</h1>
<p>
Some types of objects, like Sockets, need to be closed.
This type of assurance is supported by classes which implement
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/reactors/Closeable.html">Closeable</a>.
The Reactor method <a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/reactors/Reactor.html#addCloseable-org.agilewiki.jactor2.core.reactors.Closeable-">addCloseable</a>
can then be used to ensure that the Closeable is closed when the Reactor is closed.
But note that weak references are used to track closeables, 
and there is no assurance that close will be called on an object that has been garbage collected.
