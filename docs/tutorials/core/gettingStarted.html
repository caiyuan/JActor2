</p>
<h1>Getting Started - Jars and Scripts</h1>
<p>
You will need a few things to work with JActor2 core:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html">JDK 7</a> or later.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/download.html">slf4j</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pcollections/downloads/detail?name=pcollections-2.1.2.jar">Google pcollections</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/">Google guava</a>.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="jactor2-core-0.7.0.jar">JActor2 core jar file</a>. And
</li>
<li>
A test script.
For windows, you can use <a href="test.bat">test.bat</a>:
<pre>
del *.class
javac -classpath jactor2-core-0.7.0.jar;slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar *.java
java -classpath jactor2-core-0.7.0.jar;slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar;slf4j-simple-1.7.5.jar;pcollections-2.1.2.jar;guava-15.0.jar;. %1
</pre>
Othrwise, you can likely use <a href="test.sh">test.sh</a>:
<pre>
rm -fr *.class
javac -cp jactor2-core-0.7.0.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar *.java
java -cp jactor2-core-0.7.0.jar:slf4j-api-1.7.5.jar:slf4j-simple-1.7.5.jar:pcollections-2.1.2.jar:guava-15.0.jar:. $1
</pre>
</li>
</ull>
<h2>Debug</h2>
<p>
JActor has a debug mode. And when running in debug mode, additional checking is done that
is likely too slow for production use. But it can be great when testing.
Debug mode is set by assigning "true" to the jactor.debug system property.
For example, you can turn debug mode on by adding this parameter when running JActor:
</p>
<pre>
-Djactor.debug=true
</pre>
<p>
One of the things that jactor does when in debug mode is to track all pending requests.
They are kept in the pendingRequests variable in each Facility instance.
</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * When DEBUG, pendingRequests holds the active requests ordered by timestamp.
     */
    public final ConcurrentSkipListMap<Long, Set<RequestBase>> pendingRequests =
            Plant.DEBUG ? new ConcurrentSkipListMap<Long, Set<RequestBase>>() : null;
</pre>
<p>
One fairly common bug is when no response is passed back for a request. This can cause an
application to hang unexpectedly. Difficult to debug without some means of finding the pending requests.
Fortunately, the presence of this type of bug is quickly discovered in unit testing.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
When no other configuration is specified, the 
PlantConfiguration
<a href="../../api/org/agilewiki/jactor2/core/facilities/PlantConfiguration.html">PlantConfiguration</a>
class is used.
</p>
<p>
This timer is set to a default value of 1 second, though it is easily customized for any part of JActor.
The default can also be changed by assigning a value, in milliseconds, to the system property 
jactor.threadInterruptMilliseconds.
For example, you can set the timer to 1 minute by adding this parameter when running JActor:
</p>
<pre>
-Djactor.threadInterruptMilliseconds=60000
</pre>
<p>
If, for example, you have a tight loop that runs for a second or more and 
which does not perform any messaging nor check to see if the current message is closed,
then you should either change the timer for the part of JActor that is executing the message or
change the default.
